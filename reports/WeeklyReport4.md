# Steven Van Heiningen 
This week I created more functionalities (login page, create account page) to the survey and merged my code with Andres. When merging we encountered several problems which delay our progress: Creation of useless files by QT, compatibility issues between Mac and Windows or the QT designer, different versions of QT between our computers.
Next week I will be continuing tackling these issues and we will merge the code of the different subteams in the UI team. I will also be working with the Data team to make sure we ask the user for the inputs needed in the data-part.
