This week, in the Survey part since we had a lot of problems connecting different windows together, and with the compatibilities of the project between different devices, we decided to change into a QTab widget, instead of different QMainWindows. We mantained the same displaying, pictures and code we had in our previous project. We fixed the laying out problems we had before with full screen, and we did a StyleSheet update so that it matches the overall design of the app.
We also merged the initial survey and the general layout of the GUI projects and linked them together. We can now go from one to another, depending on whether a new user connects and goes to survey then mainwindow, or if a user wants to update their base consumption by going from mainwindow to survey.
I started working on a dictionary to gather all the challenges with their respective explanations that a user can do to decrease their carbon footprint and gain seeds in our GUI.

Next week the UI team needs to merge graphs into the UI general project, finish the dictionary of the challenges and gather the data from the survey in the right format for it to be usable for graphs and functions of data team.

# Nina Bili Rossi
This week I worked on figuring alternatives to the use of the pie chart depending on what data will potentially be available. I also worked on graph design.

# Marc Saouda
This week, I worked on having all the different cases for transport input. And I also worked on testing if the Transport class is compatible with the functions I have created. Next week, I will work o linking the Transport class to the Object class and add destructors and fix the constructors and I will work with UI team to integrate the feature in the application as well as help the data team with the testing.

# Jane Peltier
This week i worked on finishing the design of the windows with comparative graphs, adding a calendar to keep track of the date. I also coded the graph that will be on the front ui page, that when it is clicked will lead to the comparative graphs page.
Next week I plan on adding the front page graph to the front page and coding the part that leads to the comparative graphs page.

# Amine Lamouchi 
This week, I first attended a meeting to present the progress of the data team and did some demos of the code I wrote so far. After that I worked on merging the OCR with the queries program, but I was unsuccessful in solving their compatibility issues. This is mostly due to the difficulty of sending multiple queries at once, and parsing their response one by one. My goal is to solve this in the first half of the coming week as we are currently merging the different branches.

# Lucas Serog 
This week I continued helping with the merging of the data code and the UI code. I gave a bit of clarity to Steven on what types of questions we will need to ask to users in order to get the information necessary from them. Additionally, I began testing the classes and their functions to make sure they worked properly. Specifically the object class. I found an error where I needed to implement pointers in order for the program not to bug.

# Alexandra Catalina Negoita
This week, I created a method that gets a profile picture from the user, where I also checked if the picture is valid or not. Then, I worked on creating tests for different functions in the User class. I tested if the name of the user is valid (i.e. if the first character is a capital letter and the rest of the name contains normal letters or spaces), if the user's birthday is valid, and if the seeds, living partners and footprint are positive numbers.
Next week, I will finish the user's tests, and I will work on the tests of other classes.


# Jade Rakotondradano 
This week I worked on the food class. In particular, I tested each of the functions to see whether the output was correct. If there was an issue, I worked on correcting the functions so that it would be functional. I then completed some extra functions to add and update on the Merging branch (the most up-to-date branch). I will now be working with the UI graph team to merge what we have done with data. This requires helping them to merge internally and then creating functions to assign variables and attributes to parts of their graph using c++.


# Dain Jung 
This week, I implemented an animation for the daily challenges, did research on putting illustration for the UI (especially gif).

Next week, I am going to create a gif and illustration for the ranking and “your friends” part also merge with the whole UI teams by solving the conflicts

# Zhihui Li
This week, I fixed the console program bug and now the TCPserver server has been fully implemented. I worked with UI team to integrate the TCPclient with the existing UI.

Next week, I will create the console version of client TCPserver and help merge  them with the UI.

# Steven van Heiningen
This week I started by continuing to work on the profile set-up. I changed the former lay-out (one which switches between different dialogs) to a tab lay-out (switches between tabs within dialog). Later this week I worked along with Lucas from the data team so that I could create the lay-out for the log-in page. Lastly, we merged the Profile-UI branch with the Main.
Next week I will design the 'survey' to input a new emission and I will continue merging between the UI teams and the others.

# Cyrine Ben Tanfous
This week, I started by solving my photo implementation issue, for the info/tips page. Thus, I modified/designed the photos and then added them to the UI. I have also made other layout changes in this page to finalize this tab. I am planning next week to add some animation features for the tips part. On the other hand, with Andres we started creating dictionaries in order to be able to create a function that will pick randomly the tips and challenges. So, I will keep working on this part in order to finish setting it, and also try to figure out with Dain a way to implement the friends tab, which is a bit more tricky. Finally, we will finish merging with the graph team tomorrow!
