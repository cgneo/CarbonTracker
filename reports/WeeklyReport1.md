Weekly Report #1

Steven Van Heiningen: 
This week, apart from the tutorial, I looked into using the QT creator for the GUI, decided upon my role in the team and we had a meeting to organize the project. 

Marc Saouda: 
This week, I researched possible ways to get data from a website. I found out that I could do that by sending an HTML query and reading the HTML code of the website.
Although it might not be optimal, I will look into that next week just to have a backup to our current plan to get the data from that website (there exists a library in Python done by the website so we need to implement multithreading). I will also start writing some of the classes we need for the transportation carbon tracker.

Jane Peltier: 
This week I did some research about how to create a user interface and found some inspiration for the carbon tracker’s potential user interface. To test out the information I found on how to code a UI, I tried coding a first UI by watching a youtube video about it.
Next week I plan on beginning to adapt the coded interface from this week to the wanted design we will speak about during the next lecture with the UI subteam.

Lucas Serog: 
I mostly focused on researching the carbon footprints of transportation. I also looked a little into compiling with qmake but still not very well versed in it.

Dain Jung: 
I did research on the libraries that can be used for user interface and the explored how they function. Also I tried to familiarize myself with the QT libraries for user interface by watching Youtube tutorials and trying to displace the widgets.
Next week, I will work with the user interface team and we will divide the specific tasks and going to start working on making the template of user interface.

Jade Rakotondradano:
This week I worked on the trello. I organized our tasks and assigned them to different groups. I made sure that it was as clear as possible so that everyone can be organized and make its usage as easy as possible. I then did some research on APIs, how they work and how we would implement them. I watched some YouTube tutorials to have a clearer idea of APIs and i looked up openfoodfacts, an API that we will use.

Andrés Orduña:
I am working in the user interface of our project. This week I explored the QT creator desktop application builder. Specifically, I saw how the widgets were displayed and the overall properties of the basic widget classes, by following some youtube tutorials.
Next week, we have to meet all the UI team to divide the specific groups: ours first sub-teams are, graphs, how data is displayed and how to input data in a user friendly way.

Nina Bili Rossi:
I did some research on how to build a GUI using the tools from Qt Creator, and tried out some features to get a grasp of how it works. I explored the Qt Widgets C++ Classes

Amine Lamouchi: 
I researched optical character recognition libraries and identified two potential libraries we could use. I also started reading about their compatibility with the different architectures.

Catalina Negoita:
This week, I wrote a README.me file in our git repository with a description of our project and a list of project members and their roles. Also, I did some research into server design and implementation.

Zhihui Li: 
This week I invited instructors as collaborators to the project and uploaded user interface inspirations.
Next week I will design and implement the user interface.


Cyrine Ben Tanfous:
During this first week tutorial, we were mainly interested in understanding how it would be possible to code our user interface using QT creator, therefore, guided by a Youtube video we tried to start a first draft of a potential UI in order to see what it would be like.
We also looked at some inspirations of user interface, for example of some counting calories apps which are really trendy at this moment.

Alejandro Christlieb: 
Throughout this week I made sure that everyone within the team had specific tasks and I appointed sub-leaders to each of our inner teams to ensure a better organization of the project. I also worked on the project set-up and discussed with the team how we will be implementing our project. 
Lastly, I looked into the OpenFoodFacts API and how we are going to access its data. One of the possibilities researched and discusses was to create a C++ script to execute Python commands through the DB’s API. I will look more into this next week.
